    Carry Configured Service Optionality Through to Generated package.json

    ## Before this PR
    Service optionality was completely ignored

    ## After this PR
    Now if you configure something as optional it should be reflected in the TS dep (this is already true for Java)

    ## Possible downsides?
    Doesn't generate retroactively, so there is probably tons of boilerplate
