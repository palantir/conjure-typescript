# conjure-typescript

conjure-typescript is a [Conjure](https://github.com/palantir/conjure) generator for TypeScript, written in TypeScript.

## Overview

conjure-typescript is tool that allows you to generate TypeScript clients for a Conjure-defined API.
The generated clients provide a simple Promise based interface for executing strongly typed remote procedure calls from
the browser or server.

## Usage

The easiest way to use conjure-typescript is through one of the follow build tools:
- [Gradle](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-conjure)

Usage from a npm package is also supported by adding a devDependency on the `conjure-typescript` and invoking the exposed script:
```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "conjure-typescript": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

Usage from any other environment is supported by downloading a standalone executable from
[bintray](https://dl.bintray.com/palantir/releases/) at `com.palantir.conjure.typescript:conjure-typscript:<version>`
maven coordinates.

The conjure-typescript cli has the following command:
```
conjure-typescript generate

## SemVer releases

This project is versioned according to [SemVer](https://semver.org/).  We consider the generated code to be part of the 'public API' of conjure-typescript, i.e. TypeScript generated by old conjure-typescript and new conjure-typescript (within a major version) should be compatible, so your consumers should be able to upgrade without compilation problems.

We also consider the command line interface and feature flags to be public API.
