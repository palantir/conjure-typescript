- Open a PR (optionally linking to a github issue)

## Local Development

### Prerequisites: 

- Node 8+ (On macOS: `brew install node`)
- Yarn package manager 1.6+ (On macOS: `brew install yarn`)

### One-time setup for development

### Development tips

- Use `yarn lint-fix` to reformat and fix any lint errors using TSLint.
- User `yarn verify` to lint and test
- Use `yarn build` to quickly lint, compile and test the package.
- When modifying the generated code run `RECREATE=true yarn test` to automatically regenerate the test cases
